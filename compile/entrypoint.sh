# INSTALL REQUIRED PACKAGES ----------------------------------------------------

# Download "arm-eabi-gcc" compiler and install it...

# Create a dedicated folder to extract the archive into
# mkdir 'make directory', -p 'make parent directories as needed'
mkdir -p ./Utilities/PC_Software/arm-eabi-gcc-toolchain
cd       ./Utilities/PC_Software/arm-eabi-gcc-toolchain
# wget 'get from the Web', -q 'quiet, avoid printing log',
#                          -O filename 'specify name of destination file'
wget -q -O gcc.tar.bz2 $GCC_URL
# tar 'tape archiver', -j 'use Bzip compression', -x 'eXtract archive',
#                      -f 'use File given as parameter'
tar -jxf gcc.tar.bz2 --strip=1

#  scope to all environments

# in case arm-none-eabi-gcc compiler is not installed, install it.

# LAUNCH COMPILATION -----------------------------------------------------------
